# Just "No more 8 hours job interview test project"

## Description:
  We need to create app with live video record and text annotations

#### Issues:
  - Recording right after run (Need record by click record button)
  - Aspect ratio issues: with record and play picture, also with timestamp text
  - Text is static (Need dynamic timestamp with sprites sheet font)
  
#### Challenges:
  - OpenGL text print
  - OpenGL offscreen buffer
  - Video record with annotations
